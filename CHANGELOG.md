# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **modde**: Renamed `modde-cli` crate to `modde` — the CLI binary is now built
  from `crates/modde` and published to crates.io as `modde`. All internal and
  documentation references updated.
- **modde-ui**: Embedded app window icon from `dist/com.tartanoglu.modde.png`.

### Added

- **Packaging**: Desktop file, AppStream metainfo, and app icon installed for
  Nix, RPM, and Debian packages; Chocolatey metadata extended with license,
  icon, docs, bug tracker, and project source URLs.
- **Release**: Release notes now extract only the current version's section
  from CHANGELOG.md instead of posting the entire file.
- **Release**: Windows packaging (Chocolatey, Scoop, Winget) delegated to
  `simit dist windows publish`.

### CI

- **CI**: Consolidated per-crate CI workflows into single jobs on
  `atlas-nix-trusted` (removed multi-tier `codeberg-tiny`/`codeberg-medium`/
  `codeberg-small` orchestration).
- **CI**: Replaced `publish-crate-modde-cli.yaml` with
  `publish-crate-modde.yaml` targeting the renamed `modde` crate.
- **Release**: SRPM artifacts stored at `srpms/` instead of
  `target/modde-release/root-artifacts/srpms/`.

### Fixed

- **modde-games**: Use `Result::is_ok_and` over `ok().is_some_and` in Heroic
  launcher detection.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-15

### Changed

- **modde-games**: Split large monolithic files (`detection.rs`, `launcher.rs`,
  `registry.rs`, `tools/mod.rs`, `tools/mangohud.rs`, `traits.rs`) into focused
  submodules.
- **modde-oracle**: Split monolithic `lib.rs` into dedicated modules for
  aggregate, app, error, postgres, rate_limit, store, and tests.
- **modde-ui**: Split large files (`app.rs`, `update.rs`, `action_button.rs`,
  `screenshot.rs`, `sidebar.rs`, `tools.rs`, `wabbajack.rs`, `tests.rs`) into
  focused submodules.

### CI

- **Release**: Relocated COPR Makefile from `.copr/Makefile` to
  `dist/copr/Makefile`, simplified the Makefile build, removed `debug_package`
  and cargo profile overrides from RPM spec, added APT signing key.

### Fixed

- **Lint**: Added `#![allow(clippy::wildcard_imports)]` and normalized import
  formatting across `modde-cli`, `modde-core`, and `modde-sources`.
- **modde-ui**: Fixed private function visibility in `screenshot_parts/fixtures.rs`
  and removed unused imports in `screenshot.rs`.
- **modde-cli**: Added missing `std::path::PathBuf` import in `cli/runtime.rs`.
- **modde-games**: Fixed broken intra-doc links in `tools/settings.rs`,
  `traits/deploy.rs`, and `traits/game_plugin.rs` after module splits.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-13

### Added

- **CLI/Core**: Added portable `modde.lock` export, signing, verification, and
  import workflows for reproducible profile snapshots.
- **CLI/Core**: Added `modde bisect` and `modde perf` workflows for isolating
  bad mods and comparing profile performance against recorded baselines.
- **CLI/Core**: Added patcher pipeline validation, single-stage execution,
  reorder support, timeouts, cache hits, and failed-run output rollback.
- **CLI/Core**: Added experimental Cyberpunk 2077 hot-deploy support for
  patching cosmetic mods into a live VFS without a full redeploy.
- **Diagnostics**: Added crash-log correlation and `modde doctor explain`
  support that connects local Crash Logger SSE or Trainwreck evidence to the
  managed profile state.
- **Games**: Added native Bethesda record-reference validation for Skyrim,
  Fallout, and Starfield plugin orders before persisting unsafe changes.
- **Telemetry**: Added an opt-in compatibility oracle reporting path with
  hashed crash signatures, hashed mod identities, retry storage, and
  cohort-threshold query suppression.

### Changed

- **Release ops**: Hardened stable distribution automation for Codeberg release
  assets, Debian/APT, AUR, COPR, Scoop, Chocolatey, Homebrew, winget, Flatpak,
  AppImage, and tarball outputs.

### Fixed

- **Database**: Added the missing diagnostics migration tables needed by the
  crash and doctor workflows.
- **CLI**: Hardened command parsing, crash-action handling, download queue
  sidecar status parsing, and doctor help snapshots.

### Documentation

- **Docs**: Cleaned public install-channel wording so live Nix/Home-Manager
  paths are not confused with staged package-manager channels, fixed stale CLI
  examples, and moved internal planning notes out of the public mdBook source.
- **Docs tooling**: Added `cargo xtask docs-validate` to build mdBook docs,
  check local Markdown links, and reject known-stale command examples.
- **Starfield**: Clarified `.sfs` save capture and the save-contamination
  removal gate in the README, supported-games table, and parity reference.

## [0.3.8] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- **Release ops**: Regenerated the release workflow so unsigned Windows archive
  packaging does not rely on `OLDPWD` under strict shell mode, and regenerated
  CI workflows so release tags do not queue per-crate checks ahead of the
  artifact publisher.

## [0.3.7] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- **Release ops**: Regenerated the release workflow so unsupported Debian
  package chroot setup warns and continues, allowing Codeberg release assets to
  publish before optional `.deb`/APT artifacts.

## [0.3.6] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- **Release ops**: Regenerated the release workflow with a Debian packaging
  step that works on rootful trusted runners without requiring `sudo`, so
  `.deb` asset creation can reach Codeberg release publication.

## [0.3.5] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- **Release ops**: Made Codeberg release asset publication run before optional Attic cache pushes so missing runner cache tokens cannot block downloadable release files.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-06-07

### Fixed

- **Release ops**: Retried the release after the trusted runner service was
  restarted during the `0.3.3` artifact build, cancelling the job before
  Codeberg release publication.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-06-07

### Fixed

- **Release ops**: Align the RPM source archive name with the generated
  release workflow so SRPM creation can find the local source archive.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-06-07

### Fixed

- **Release ops**: Allow the workspace's `GPL-3.0-only` license expression in
  the release supply-chain policy.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-07

### Fixed

- **Release ops**: Updated the committed minisign public key to match the
  Codeberg release signing secret so checksum signing passes preflight.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-03

### Added

- **Core/CLI**: Added an async SQLx-backed database layer with SQLite by
  default, optional PostgreSQL support, migrations, parity tests, and
  `modde config` commands for inspecting and setting the database backend.
- **Release ops**: Added reusable `nix run .#sign-release` and
  `nix run .#verify-release` minisign helpers for local/CI release-signature
  parity.

### Changed

- **GUI**: Moved profile, tool, and settings writes off the iced render thread
  so UI update handlers dispatch database work asynchronously.
- **Release ops**: Regenerated simit-managed crate CI/publish workflows and
  added the generated pre-commit hook module.
- **Release ops**: Renamed the Debian/Ubuntu APT publication repository from
  `caniko/rs-modde-apt` to `caniko/apt-modde`.

### Fixed

- **Release ops**: Hardened Codeberg release dispatch and publish workflows so
  artifact builds run from the validated signed tag and keep the dispatch target
  on `trunk`.
- **Builds**: Fixed Windows release builds and macOS cross-builds, including
  sandboxed SDK wiring, OpenSSL-free local git usage, and osxcross
  `codesign_allocate` handling.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-31

### Added

- **Homebrew**: Tap available at `brew tap caniko/modde https://codeberg.org/caniko/homebrew-modde.git`.
- **Release ops**: Release CI supports `rc`, `beta`, and `alpha` prerelease tags, marks Codeberg prereleases correctly, skips stable-only publish channels for prereleases, and routes prerelease COPR builds to `caniko/rs-modde-testing`.
- **Release ops**: Stable releases can announce to Mastodon and Matrix with the release URL and a short changelog excerpt.
- **CLI/UI**: `modde update check` can check for a newer modde release, and the GUI shows a non-modal update banner when one is available.

### Changed

- **Internal**: Homebrew tap publish step in release CI now generated by
  `simit init-ci --with-homebrew`; behaviour unchanged.
- **Release ops**: Release CI now fails early when the tag does not have a matching dated `CHANGELOG.md` section.

### Documentation

- **Release ops**: Documented hotfix, RC, announcement-token, and yank/withdraw release procedures.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-19

### Added

- **Skyrim/Wabbajack**: Support Wabbajack `GameFileSourceDownloader` entries used by Legends of the Frost, with local game-file verification through `--game-dir`.
- **Nix**: Home Manager Wabbajack profiles now fetch, install, and deploy declarative modlists, including explicit `gameDir` support.
- **Nix**: Home Manager profiles can now wait non-fatally for a game install through `installMode = "await-game"` or missing `gameDir` prerequisites.
- **Tests**: Hardened Wabbajack game-file-source regressions and the Nix sandbox-sensitive deploy pipeline test.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-13
